Interesting relationships/trends: We are interested in analyzing what exactly is filed as an adverse symptom and which companies are responsible in having manufactured these vaccines. There may be companies which were interested in outputting a large number of vaccines without refining the symptoms that may come along. We are also interested in how minor/major the symptoms are.
