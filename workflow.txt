A description of Airflow workflow to be implemented in Milestone 12

Task: copyPrimaryInfo
	This will copy the original primary info table from Big Query that was unioned based on several different year tables from Enigma. 

Task: changeNulls_toStrings
	This function will change all null values in the state, hospitalization, disabled, died and recovered fields to "False" (hospitalization, disabled, died) or "U" (state, recovered). This task is dependent on the copyPrimaryInfo function that gets the table.

Task: normalizeValues
	This will check for correct capitalization of the state, sex and recovered fields. If an entry is not capitalized correctly, this will change it accordingly. This is dependent on changeNulls_toStrings because we want to correct the fields after they've been populated. 


Workflow:

copyPrimaryInfo >> changeNulls_toStrings >> normalizeValues
