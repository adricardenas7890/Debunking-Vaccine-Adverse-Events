WORKFLOW.txt
A description of Airflow workflow to be implemented in Milestone 12

Task: createPrimaryInfo
	This will create the BQ workflow file

Task: fillPrimaryInfo
	This will fill the BQ dataset with the dataset2.primaryinfo table, which has already been unioned. 

Task: changeNullsState
	This function will change all null values in state to "U". This task is dependent on fillPrimaryInfo and createPrimaryInfo. It is independent from all others.

Task: changeNullsHospital
	This function will change all null values in state to "false". This task is dependent on fillPrimaryInfo and createPrimaryInfo. It is independent from all others.

Task: changeNullsDisabled
	This function will change all null values in disabled to "false". This task is dependent on fillPrimaryInfo and createPrimaryInfo. It is independent from all others.

Task: changeNullsDied
	This function will change all null values in died to "false". This task is dependent on fillPrimaryInfo and createPrimaryInfo. It is independent from all others.

Task: changeNullsRecovered
	This function will change all null values in recovered to "U". This task is dependent on fillPrimaryInfo and createPrimaryInfo. It is independent from all others.

Task: normalizeState
	This will check for correct capitalization of the state, sex and recovered fields. If an entry is not capitalized correctly, this will change it accordingly. This is dependent on changeNulls_toStrings because we want to correct the fields after they've been populated.
